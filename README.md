<p>This is a website of everything volunteers at the hospital information desk would ever need. It's also responsive and can work on different devices!
<p>I'm going to try and actually get it implemented at the hospital once I add in the real information!!</p>
<p>There is a search bar to search for specific key terms, a checkbox to search only through the titles (so it does not include the description or extensions).</p>
<p>In the upper right corner, there is a map of the hospital for quick and easy access. </p>
<p>All actual information, images, maps, and external websites are hidden due to privacy reasons.</p>
