<h1>The Hospital Website of Everything: Volunteer Version</h1>

[![Youtube Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOv5McYPgPM](https://img.youtube.com/vi/mOv5McYPgPM/0.jpg)]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGWQxCNp1F0](https://youtu.be/mOv5McYPgPM))

<p>This is a website of everything volunteers at the hospital information desk would ever need. The actual information in the website is not added due to confidentiality. But everything else is functional! I'm going to try and actually get it implemented at the hospital once I add in the real information!!</p>
<p>There is a search bar to search for specific key terms, a checkbox to search only through the titles (so it does not include the description or extensions).</p>
<p>In the upper right corner, there is a map of the hospital for quick and easy access. </p>
<p>All images, maps and external websites are blurred out for privacy reasons.</p>
