<h1>The Hospital Website of Everything: Volunteer Version</h1>

<p>This is a website of everything volunteers at the hospital information desk would ever need. The actual information in the website is not added due to confidentiality. But everything else is functional!</p>
<p>There is a search bar to search for specific key terms, a checkbox to search only through the titles (so it does not include the description or extensions).</p>
<p>In the upper right corner, there is a map of the hospital for quick and easy access. </p>
<p>All images and maps are blurred out for privacy reasons.</p>
